##NAME

Description:

A scholarship-finding app for students that gamifies the process with a tinder-like swiping feature and self-generating 
application based on the user info and the description for the scholarship.

To run the app:

Install all dependencies for npm. You can do this by running the command npm i in the root, server, and the client folder. You also need the latest version of dotnet (8.0.2) for AI functionality to work. After that, running the runApp.bat from the root folder will be able to run the server and the client side code.
